## vast-ai python interface
**_No warranty is given. No complaints will be answered._**

Lambda labs is always out of capacity, but I need my GPUs. 

The current [CLI interface](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vast-ai/vast-python/master/vast.py) provided was not something I liked.

Implements all the basic operation you need start, get and stop instances.

### What I use this for
- Automatically start up a machine and upload experiments 
- Automatically stop machines at night (as I sometimes forget to stop them hehe)
